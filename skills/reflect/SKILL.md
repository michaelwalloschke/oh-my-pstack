# Reflect

Follow the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md) for transcript discovery, child roles, model choices, tool access, questions, and skill authoring.

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent resolves its own transcript before fanning out. Use the host's active history resource, an explicit transcript directory, or `$PSTACK_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR`, in that order. Never scan another workspace or a global vendor history tree. If no transcript resolves, write a tight digest of the session and use that instead.

When the host provides transcript files, confirm the candidate's conversation identity from its metadata and opening user prompt. Parse only its documented format. Do not assume a particular JSONL layout or infer the active conversation from the newest filename.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

The root launches three reviewer children concurrently through the host's task facility. Use the configured choices when present; otherwise map the canonical roles below through the live host inventory. Send each lane through the host's model routing, as [Models and routing](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md#models-and-routing) describes. Lanes that run through one agent share its model. Leave the model unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent` when the host can pass the parent model to a child. If the host rejects a configured choice, honor its documented rejection and fallback policy and report the gap; do not guess a vendor family or substitute a default slug.

Grant each child read access to the transcript and any host tools needed for context lookups, but forbid file writes in the brief. If the host cannot combine read-only repository posture with external-tool access, preserve tool access and enforce no writes in the brief; the parent applies edits. A missing child facility is a capability gap, not a completed reflect.

| Lens | Configured choice / fallback role | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment`, else `reviewer` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling`, else `researcher` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect divergent`, else a distinct live-host child not used for judgment or tooling | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in their child reports. Each reviewer lists every durable learning it finds; there is no 3-5 cap.

## 3. Synthesize

The root launches one `synthesizer` child, using the configured `reflect synthesizer` choice when present. Give it the host tools needed to spot-verify citations while forbidding repository writes in its standalone brief. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File Backlog items only when the user or standing policy authorizes writes to that tracker. Otherwise return the proposed items with their destination. Only approved Accepted edits change skills.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): use the host's skill-authoring facility when available and run its draft / test / iterate loop; otherwise apply that loop directly.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): use the host's skill-authoring facility when available, or directly run the same description-review loop.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: use the host's skill-authoring facility when available, or author it directly from package conventions. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
