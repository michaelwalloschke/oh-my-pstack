# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Follow the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md) for child roles, models, and capability gaps. The root starts every child. Use the `how explorer` and `how explainer` choices from `$PSTACK_CONFIG` when set, otherwise `.pstack/config.md`. Without a configured choice, map the canonical `explorer` and `synthesizer` roles through the live host inventory. Send each child through the host's model routing, as [Models and routing](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md#models-and-routing) describes. Leave the model unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent` when the host can pass the parent model to a child. If the host rejects a configured choice, honor its documented rejection and fallback policy and report the gap; do not guess a vendor family or substitute a default slug. If children are unavailable, the root may explain directly but must report the missing independent exploration or synthesis.

## 1. Assess complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. Spawn one explainer that explores and explains in one pass, built from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to step 4.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): go to step 2.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## 2. Explore (complex only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. The root starts all read-only explorers concurrently within host capacity, each with `references/explorer-prompt.md` and its angle filled in.

## 3. Synthesize (complex only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one explainer with `references/explainer-prompt.md` and every explorer's findings filled in.

## 4. Present

Present the explainer's output. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
