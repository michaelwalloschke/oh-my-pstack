# Swarm

Follow the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md) for worker roles, concurrent execution, models, writable isolation, and unavailable-capability fallbacks.

Fan out N parallel workers through the current host. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Track one checklist entry per phase before launching anything. Use the host's planning facility when available; otherwise keep a compact checklist in the conversation or project-local decision trail.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the host's concurrency limit. If N exceeds what the live host can run concurrently, launch in waves that respect that capacity rather than assuming remote cloud workers.
4. Pick the worker choice from the `swarm workers` line in `$PSTACK_CONFIG` when that variable is set, otherwise `.pstack/config.md`. If that line is missing, map the canonical `implementer` role through the live host inventory. Send each worker through the host's model routing, as [Models and routing](../pstack-pi/references/runtime.md#models-and-routing) describes. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit an explicit model when the host can pass the parent model to a child. If the host rejects a configured choice, honor its documented rejection and fallback policy and report the gap; do not guess a vendor family or substitute a default slug. For a model race, name each arm's role or model choice up front, and give each arm its own agent when the host routes by agent name, because arms on one agent run one model. A missing child facility is a capability gap, not a swarm.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

The root launches all N workers concurrently through the host's task facility using the configured choice, in waves if the host capacity requires it. Use the environment the current host actually provides; do not assume remote execution, uploaded repositories, or access to the user's machine. If workers need a non-default branch or checkout, name it in each standalone brief and verify that the host can access it before launch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
