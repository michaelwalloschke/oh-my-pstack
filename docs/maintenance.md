# Maintenance

This document is for people who update, verify, or release the fork. Consumer install steps live in [installation.md](installation.md).

## Versions

`package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` must agree on the fork version. The current unreleased version is `0.15.29-omp.1`.

[upstream.lock.json](../upstream.lock.json) records the Cursor source version and exact commit separately. Sync updates that pin. It does not rewrite fork manifests. Read the lock when comparing source baselines instead of copying its commit into consumer documentation.

SemVer treats the `omp` suffix as a prerelease. After publication, npm examples should use `pstack-pi@omp`, not an implied stable `latest` release. Git installation remains the primary path until a version is actually on the registry.

When preparing a release after a reviewed source advance, choose a corresponding fork version explicitly. Independent fork fixes on the same baseline increment the omp revision, for example `0.15.13-omp.2`.

## Deterministic checks

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run verify
node --test scripts/verify.test.mjs scripts/sync-upstream.test.mjs scripts/sync-proposal.test.mjs scripts/omp-rpc.test.mjs scripts/omp-provenance.test.mjs scripts/package.test.mjs scripts/worktree-audit.test.mjs
bun test skills/poteto-mode/scripts/orch skills/poteto-mode/scripts/watch-pr skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.test.ts
bun run --cwd skills/poteto-mode/scripts typecheck
```

`npm run verify` checks skill inventory, frontmatter, local references, `skill://` targets, manifests, the upstream lock, and forbidden vendor-specific runtime bindings. Skill resource targets must resolve to files within their named skill.

`npm run test:package` packs with npm, extracts the tarball, and runs the verifier on that tree. A missing installed skill resource must fail.

## Isolated installation

The installation gate requires OMP, Pi, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Git, and outbound package/GitHub access:

```bash
npm run test:install
PSTACK_INSTALL_HOSTS=omp npm run test:install
PSTACK_INSTALL_SOURCE=https://github.com/michaelwalloschke/oh-my-pstack npm run test:install
```

The default run installs an isolated copy of this checkout. `PSTACK_INSTALL_HOSTS` selects named hosts; unknown names fail. A local directory can also be supplied as `PSTACK_INSTALL_SOURCE`. Each host receives a disposable HOME/project and temporary XDG roots. Missing hosts and discovery failures fail rather than skip.

Use `PSTACK_OMP_BIN`, `PSTACK_PI_BIN`, `PSTACK_OPENCODE_BIN`, `PSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN`, `PSTACK_CODEX_BIN`, and `PSTACK_GEMINI_BIN` to select direct installed executables. Avoid tool-manager wrappers that change global configuration.

## Authenticated OMP smoke

Model-backed smoke is separate from credential-free CI:

```bash
PSTACK_OMP_MODEL=openai-codex/gpt-6.1-sol:low npm run smoke:omp
```

Set `PSTACK_OMP_MODEL` to an exact available `provider/model` selector. A documented thinking suffix is kept only when that model supports it. Do not substitute another model. The provider must also expose a second chat model that supports the same thinking level: the routing phase runs the parent on it so a child on the exact selector proves the override, not inheritance. Set `PSTACK_OMP_PARENT_MODEL=<provider>/<model>` to choose that parent model explicitly; otherwise the first compatible one is used. The script uses disposable HOME state, resolves the credential through `omp token` (or `PSTACK_OMP_API_KEY`), and does not print credentials. A missing model, unsupported thinking level, missing second model, or missing capability fails rather than skips.

Beyond the skill and setup phases, the smoke covers:

- **Routing.** `/skill:setup-pstack` must route every live role-target agent in the project `.omp/config.yml` while preserving unrelated `retry`/`task` keys and a plugin agent's distinct override. Read-back uses an empty HOME to prove the project layer owns the routing; the disposable global config and overlay must remain unchanged. After restarting OMP, a `task` child's journal must record the exact provider/model on every assistant attempt, at least one completed response, the full resolved thinking selector, and no fallback, while its parent runs a different model. The child's own response and saved result must contain the requested nonce. Journals come only from that parent's artifact directory and must bind through `parentSession`. `scripts/omp-provenance.mjs` implements the evidence checks; `npm run test:omp-provenance` exercises them without credentials, including colon-containing model IDs. Configured routing, resolved records, assistant attempts, completed replies, and auxiliary `model_usage` stay distinct. The task `model` field belongs to seance and is not used.
- **Isolation.** With `task.isolation.enabled`, `apply=false` and `merge=patch`, an `isolated: true` child must run in a different root, its relative write must appear in its `<id>.patch`, and the parent HEAD, tracked diff and untracked file contents (one SHA-256 fingerprint) must be unchanged. This shows relative-path routing only, not filesystem containment.
- **Subagent lifecycle.** One child must report `started` and `completed` frames, produce its first reply, and have that result read before a direct `write agent://<id>` follow-up. Its journal must then contain a completed assistant reply after the delivered request, and a correlated `history://<id>` read must show that reply. The request echo alone is not proof. The smoke does not assert that `agent://<id>` stays frozen.
- **Native async.** A finite async bash job must yield before settlement and be delivered on the follow-up wake.

## Reviewed upstream synchronization

`.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` checks the original pstack `main` branch every six hours at minute 17 and can also be started manually. The candidate job has read-only permissions and disabled checkout credentials. If owned `skills/` or `upstream.lock.json` files change, it verifies the tree and uploads only `proposal.patch` and `metadata.json`. A second job applies that artifact with `scripts/sync-proposal.mjs` in a trusted checkout and opens an inspectable pull request. It does not merge automatically.

When reconciliation needs explicit decisions, the candidate instead uploads an `upstream-review` artifact for 14 days and lists conflicts and resolution commands in the job summary. It leaves the source pin unchanged and skips the proposal job. Missing source objects, invalid manifests, and failed review exports still fail the workflow.

A failed application must not advance the pin. There is no rollback journal; recover by discarding the dirty tree and keeping the last successful lock.

`--source` is a trusted local development override. It is not a signature, ancestry, or multi-upstream framework.

### Local review export

The parent directory must already exist. The review leaf must not. Use a fresh name for another export.

```bash
npm run sync:check
npm run sync:apply -- --dry-run
npm run sync:export-review -- /tmp/pstack-review-new
npm run sync:apply -- --review /tmp/pstack-review-new --dry-run
```

Protected adaptation changes require an explicit review decision. The updater never silently overwrites them. Ordinary clean updates stay planner-owned.

Exit code 2 is a reconciliation rejection, not a Node or Ubuntu version error. Resolve the listed file conflicts with a fresh export before another update can advance the pin.

Skill links into upstream `pstack/docs/` are rewritten to public GitHub URLs pinned to the imported commit because this package does not bundle those docs.

## Publish an npm release

The `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml` workflow runs only when a GitHub Release is published. It checks out the release tag and requires `v<version>` to match `package.json` exactly. It verifies the package, runs the real pack gate, then runs `npm publish --access public --provenance --tag omp`. A failed publish fails the workflow. The workflow does not bump versions, push commits or tags, or publish to GitHub Packages. The release tag for this version is `v0.15.29-omp.1`.

Before using the workflow, configure a
[trusted publisher on npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) for
`pstack-pi` with these GitHub Actions settings:

- Organization or user is `michaelwalloschke`.
- Repository is `oh-my-pstack`.
- Workflow filename is `publish-npm.yml`.
- Leave the environment name empty.
- Allow direct publishing with `npm publish`.

This is a one-time npm-side setup, not a setting the workflow can create.
If npm requires an existing package before you can configure its trusted
publisher, a package owner must publish the initial version manually first.
The workflow uses GitHub OIDC and does not require an `NPM_TOKEN` secret.

Publishing from this fork requires authorization from the npm package owner. A Git fork alone does not grant that access.

After the version change has been reviewed and merged, create its matching
`v<version>` tag and publish a GitHub Release for that tag. Use a new package
version for each release because npm versions cannot be republished.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes with read-only permissions. It runs verify, verifier/updater/proposal/RPC/provenance/worktree-audit unit tests, the real package test, bundled Bun tests, and strict typecheck. Model-backed smoke and the multi-host install suite stay separate.
